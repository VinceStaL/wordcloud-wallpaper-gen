I would like to create a web app to generate word cloud and user can save as wall papers for their desktop or phone.

- user can input the word, and give a rating, which will decide the size of the word in the word cloud
- words will be organised as word cloud
- user can export the word cloud to a wallpaper for desktop and phone, we can predefine the common sizes for user to select.


Tech stack:

if possible, use only html, js and css


UI/UX:

pls use ui-ux-pro-max-skill to make the app look modern,Minimalism
